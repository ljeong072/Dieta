The chatbot did well at the multiple prompts it was given and trained to do. Only thing I'd recommend is to maybe center the chatbot on the middle of the website on not on the very right side. Great chatbot and great service all around, at least 9/10."
2025/05/28 6:13:15 PM MDT,-,3,3,1,"The chatbot provided a great base for the user to start on however it did not clearly define a ""diet plan"". For example it told the user nuts, protein and healthy fats would be great to incorporate into the user's diet however there is not clear diet plan. What types of food should I avoid and how often should I eat them. What I would be looking for is the chatbot to tell me to incorporate these certain proteins for these reasons and avoid this food for this reason. This is solid however still lacking in depth of response",-,3,2,1,"Once again, the bot provides a decent response but lacks depth. I would love if the chatbot provided examples of Indian recipes that included the necessary dietary restrictions. It says to include healthy fats but what foods would have these healthy fats? ",-,2,2,1,"Chatbot responded with the assumption that I had cancer? Once again provided a simple base such as suggesting nutrient-dense foods, but I would like to know what foods are nutrient-dense. Additionally it began talking about pineapples. The chatbot overall did not provide a clear diet plan, but did responded somewhat accordingly. ",-,4,5,1,"This was the best answer out of all the prompts. It provided a clear dietary plan, but there was one issue where it still included nuts into the diet despite the prompt saying the user was allergic. Additionally, it did not acknowledge the user's enjoyment of French food and soda. However this was the most clear and concise response."
